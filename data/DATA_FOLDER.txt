This is the runtime data folder for your project.

Use it only for data that is needed and loaded at runtime by your application.
It is installed and shipped during packaging of your application.

Other data files such as desktop icons, init scripts, or files needed for packaging,
belong into the deploy directory.

Have a look at the cmake-init documentation to learn how your application is able
to locate its data folder at runtime.
